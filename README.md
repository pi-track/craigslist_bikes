Deprecated version. New version [here](https://github.com/pi-track/craigslist_scrape).

# CraigslistBikes

Building a CLI to search craigslist philly for bikes and display/sort them. Starting with bikes (because I personally don't search craigslist for anything else) and philly (because I live here) but a goal is to build this so it is open to flexible extension.

Ruby code is in the file `lib/craigslist_bikes`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'craigslist_bikes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install craigslist_bikes

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
